# NEXT CHAT BOOTSTRAP

This file is a deterministic projection of `docs/reports/handoff-packages/latest/successor_context.yaml`.
Do not start from chat memory. Read the Successor Handoff Package first.

## Current verified repository state

- Repo: `vfi64/agentic-project-kit`
- HEAD: `2a934c12ffa6a6b79060e1d96e0441aa63bb5111` (`2a934c12`)
- Branch at generation: `feature/successor-handoff-package`
- Worktree clean at generation: `False`

## Successor handoff package

- `docs/reports/handoff-packages/latest/successor_context.yaml`
- `docs/reports/handoff-packages/latest/source_manifest.json`
- `docs/reports/handoff-packages/latest/validation_report.json`
- `docs/reports/handoff-packages/latest/successor_prompt.md`

## Canonical chat-switch prompt files

- Start a successor chat with `docs/handoff/START_NEW_CHAT_PROMPT.md`.
- Before leaving a chat, run the closeout routine in `docs/handoff/CLOSEOUT_BEFORE_CHAT_SWITCH_PROMPT.md`.

## Required first action in a successor chat

1. Read the Successor Handoff Package files completely.
2. Run or request the Pflichtstart commands from the package.
3. Verify current main HEAD, local status, open PRs, CI, STATUS, CURRENT_HANDOFF, rule registry, command reference, and final-summary contracts before mutation.
4. If the package, prompts, HEAD, or validation report are stale: stop and repair handoff drift first.

## Open high-priority work

- Replace obsolete chat-switch prompt generation with this deterministic package mechanism.
- Add outer-doc currency checks and minimal updates for `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.
