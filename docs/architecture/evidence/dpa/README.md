# DPA Evidence

Status: evidence-staged

Status-date: 2026-07-28

Document class: evidence/log

## Scope

This directory stages selected DPA evidence snapshots for controlled Kit-side
planning.

The evidence imported in DPA-IMPORT-3 is historical Lab evidence against Kit
validation ref `c788a8c530eb0984d088a86e8e7951145581abbe`. It helps plan future
DP1 Probe execution and Assessment. It does not prove current Kit conformance
at `main`, does not authorize DP2 and does not replace a future exact-ref Probe
run.

## Imported Probe Evidence

- `probes/dp1-readonly-c788a8c5-20260727/` records read-only baseline evidence
  with result `PASS_WITH_LIMITATIONS`.
- `probes/dp1-mutation-sandbox-c788a8c5-20260727/` records sandbox-only mutable
  command evidence with result `PARTIAL`.

Both packages preserve their original limitation language. Future execution must
freeze current refs, record command manifest currency, retain cleanup evidence
and pass Maintainer Assessment before any DP2 implementation relies on them.
